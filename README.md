# Twitter Sentiment


This app uses [socket.io](http://socket.io/) and [express](http://expressjs.com/). There are better ones out on the interweb than this. I just wanted to play.

### Notes

Heroku (at the time of writing) don't allow sockets. I run this on my mac anyway.

### Install

- git clone https://github.com/swmcc/twitter-sentiment.git
- cd twitter-sentiment
- npm install
- node app

### TODO

- Enable more than one stream to be available.
- Have a nicer chart.
- Take in multiple/single streams via a web form instead of hard coding.
